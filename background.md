# Background

Grippers are accessories that attach to a robot and use actuation to grab objects.

## Introduction

This project is focused around developing a gripper that is light and uses foldable mechanisms to actuate using two servos. The one degree of motion is translated through the four bar linkage in order to change the position of the end effector.

## Conclusions
 TBD
